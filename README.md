## How to Use ChemBot
Once the app is running, ChemBot will greet you and guide you through your research. You can:

Enter a compound name, CID, or SMILES string.

ChemBot will fetch and display relevant properties and available file types (e.g., 2D SDF, 3D SDF, PNG).

You can choose to download specific files, get drug-likeness predictions, or add more compounds.

For returning users, ChemBot remembers your past interactions and displays your chat history for a seamless experience.

You can interact with ChemBot just like chatting with a research assistant â€” it will intelligently guide you step-by-step through compound selection, property retrieval, and data export.
